A Note on Confidentiality The data used and a subset of the results from this project are subject to a Non-Disclosure Agreement. The charts and results presented below have been modified to adhere to the NDA.

Due to the nature of confidential data, all of my work is being done in a private repository. I will be moving things into this repository as they get approved for public viewing.

# Objectives:

1) Creating a better predictive model for the marketing team to both forecast the amount of people by product and by location based on people currently in the pipeline on a weekly matter. This which would allow them to better budget for each cohort, and better understand the targets for each location in order to get to their forecasted goals.

2) Create a customer profile for the applicants of their programs, to understand the main clusters of people that tend to apply, and to better understand who they should be targetting based on the conversion rates of each of these customer profiles.
